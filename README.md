# Useless-Machine
C++ Code written in the Arduino IDE to operate a useless machine wired via an Arduino

**Parts Needed**
----------------

-Small Jewlry Box

-Arduino Uno

-Jumper Wires

-Servo Motor

-Analog On/Off switch



**Electrical Schematic**
--------------------------------
*Do note that the schematic and code differentiate slighly. TinkerCAD, the software used to create this model, only has a 3 pin switch, in reality I constructed the machine with a 2 pin switch, wiring one wire to the ground in the breadboard and another to pin #9 in the Arduino

**To Be Added**
------------
-A set of animations to be played at random each time the lever is flicked

**Usage**
-------------------
Using the Arduino IDE, flash the code to your arduino set up with a servo and lever the way I have in the schematic, based on what method you use to flcik the lever, the size of your box, and the range of your servo, degress may very. I reccomnend playing around with the motors and lever before assembly.
